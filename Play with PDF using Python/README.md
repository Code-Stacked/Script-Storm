## File Extracting Functions Description
*  We have first used the **open()** method used to open a file in Python for reading, then we will use this file object to initialize the PdfFileReader object.<br/>
*  Once we have the PdfFileReader object ready, we can use its methods like **getDocumentInfo()** to get the file information, or **getNumPages()** to get the total number of pages in the PDF file.<br/>
* Then we have the **getPage()** method to get the page from the PDF file using the page index which starts from 0, and finally the **extractText()** method which is used to extract the text from the PDF file page.
